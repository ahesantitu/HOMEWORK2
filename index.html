	<h2>WEBDESIGN:</h2>
	<h3>HTML</h3>
	<p>HTML is a markup language. What the browser sees on a site's viewer is determined by HTML. It is not a programming language, but much easier than any programming.</p>

	<h3>CSS3</h3>

	<p>It is also a markup language. This determines what the browser will look like when the content is displayed in HTML. That is how big the font will be. How much space will be left next. What will be the distance from one text to another, what will be its color, what will be the background, even animations can be added to the content with the latest CSS3.</p>

	<h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
	<p>These two are basically a bit closer to the programming language. Basically, two things work the same, but JQuery is a form of JavaScript that makes it much easier to use JavaScript on the site. And their job is to make the site interactive. In other words, if the visitor clicks on a button, the menu will open. Or if you submit a form, it will show a confirmation message, etc.</p>
